# Features

**TODO: Add features of the program**\
Our system requires the GSON Maven Repository.\
To load GSON package:\
Go to this website: \
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson/2.8.6

It should have categories such as: License, Categories, Date, Files, etc.\
On the right of Files, click on the file (it should say jar 234kb).

You may get an error saying the file is harmful, just ignore it and continue to download the file.\
Now, go back to intellij and open up the a2-eldians folder. \
Click File from the toolbar\
 Go to Project Structure (CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + S on Windows/Linux, ⌘ + ; on Mac OS X)\
 Select Modules at the left panel\
 Go to Dependencies tab\
 '+' → JARs or directories\
 Go to where you stored the downloaded jar file and select it. \
 Click apply\
 Click ok.\
It should work now.
